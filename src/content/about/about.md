Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _[Fullstack] Software Engineer_ with an enthusiastic curiosity. 

With over half a decade of industry exposure at various positions & capacities, I am a well-seasoned engineer _[trust me on this one!]_.
Deeper understanding of design principles, data structures & algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming paradigms are 
key aspects that I bring to any team. Being a bit of a perfectionist, I usually pay attention to the detail & values quality 
of work that I engage in. 

Highly motivated, team player ready to take up any technical challenge & deliver results not excuses. My stronghold is 
**Java** with **Spring Framework**. I am a fast learner with solid understanding of basics, so language does not really matter at all.
Naturally, my right-brain is a little foggy. Maintain extreme caution ⚠️ before asking me to 
 match the colors of your frontend. You are guaranteed to have colors, but only 3 of them.

A classic car enthusiast, of course, I own 1989 built **_BMW E30 316i_** my childhood dream car 🚘 !
Loves to go on long drives & occasionally a jungle safari to see my friends **🐆** ..
